	List of maintainers and how to submit changes

Please try to follow the guidelines below.  This will make things
easier on the maintainers.  Not all of these guidelines matter for every
trivial patch so apply some common sense.

1.	Always _test_ your changes, however small, on at least 4 or
	5 people, preferably many more.

2.	Make sure your changes compile correctly in multiple
	configurations. For example, both 32- and 64-bit x86.

3.	Make a patch available to the relevant maintainer in the list. Use
	'diff -u' to make the patch easy to merge. Be prepared to get your
	changes sent back with seemingly silly requests about formatting
	and variable names.  These aren't as silly as they seem. One
	job the maintainersdo is to keep things looking the same.

	PLEASE try to include any credit lines you want added with the
	patch. It avoids people being missed off by mistake and makes
	it easier to know who wants adding and who doesn't.

	PLEASE document known bugs. If it doesn't work for everything
	or does something very odd once a month document it.

	PLEASE remember that submissions must be made under the terms
	of the "Developer's Certificate of Origin" (DCO) and should include
	a Signed-off-by: line.

4.	Make sure you have the right to send any changes you make. If you
	do changes at work you may find your employer owns the patch
	not you.

5.	Happy hacking.

Descriptions of section entries:

	M: Mail patches to: FullName <address@domain>
	L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area
	W: Web-page with status/info
	T: SCM tree type and location.  Type is one of: git, hg, quilt, stgit.
	S: Status, one of the following:
	   Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	   Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	   Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	   Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	   Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	   F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	X: Files and directories that are NOT maintained, same rules as F:
	   Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
	   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	   F:	net/
	   X:	net/ipv6/
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
	K: Keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a
	   patch or file.  For instance:
	   K: of_get_profile
	      matches patches or files that contain "of_get_profile"
	   K: \b(printk|pr_(info|err))\b
	      matches patches or files that contain one or more of the words
	      printk, pr_info or pr_err
	   One regex pattern per line.  Multiple K: lines acceptable.
