Checks for the suitability of a machine for Xen build or install.
To check for build suitability use

        ./chk build

To check for install suitability use

        ./chk install

The chk script will run checks in this directory and print
the ones that failed. It prints nothing if checks succeed.
The chk script exits with 0 on success and 1 on failure.

The chk script runs executable files in this directory whose
names begin with 'check_'. Files containing CHECK-BUILD
are run for the build check, and files containing CHECK-INSTALL
are run for the install check.

Detailed output from the check scripts is in .chkbuild for build
and .chkinstall for install.
