This directory contains the implementation of vnets:
virtual private networks for virtual machines.

make
        - compile in local dirs. The module is in vnet-module/vnet_module.ko.

make dist
        - compile and install into $(XEN_ROOT)/dist/install,
        - where XEN_ROOT is the root of the xen tree.

make install
        - compile and install into system.

By default the makefiles expect this code to have been installed
in tools/vnet in a xen source tree. If compiling outside the xen
source tree, set XEN_ROOT to the location of the xen source.
You can do this in the environment or in a Make.local file
in the current directory (see Make.env for details).

The xen0 kernel must have been compiled before building the vnet module.
The vnet module installs to
 /lib/modules/<kernel version>-xen0/kernel/xen/vnet_module.ko

The vnet module should be loaded before starting xend, or
xend will fail to create any persistent vnets it has in its configuration.
The script network-vnet is a modified version of the xen network script
that loads the module if it's not already loaded.

The module uses kernel crypto functions, and these need to be
enabled in the xen0 kernel config. They should be on by default -
if they're not you will get compile or insmod errors (see below).

Kernel config options:

1)	You will need to have your xen0 kernel compiled with HMAC_SUPPORT 
	2.6.x = (MAIN MENU: Cryptographic Options -> HMAC Support)
	BEFORE running "make install".

2)	You will want at least some of the other algorithms listed under
	"Cryptographic Options" for the kernel compiled as modules.

3)	You will want the networking IPsec/VLAN options compiled in as modules
	2.6.x = (MAIN MENU: Device Drivers -> Networking Support -> 
				Networking Options ->
					IP: AH transformation
					IP: ESP transformation
					IP: IPComp transformation 
					IP: tunnel transformation

					IPsec user configuration interface
	
					802.1Q VLAN Support

Please refer to the additional documentation found in tools/vnet/doc for
proper syntax and config file parameters.
