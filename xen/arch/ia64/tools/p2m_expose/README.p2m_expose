This directory contains Linux kernel module for p2m exposure test/benchmark.

1. build kernel module
   - At fist build, linux-xen as usual
   - then type just 'make' in this directory, then you'll have expose_p2m.ko.
     See Makefile for details.

2. test, benchmark.
   - type 'insmod expose_p2m.ko' on the system.
   Then the result is printed out to your console.
   insmod fails with EINVAL so that you don't have to execute rmmod.
